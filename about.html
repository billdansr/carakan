            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                A simple website as an introduction to Javanese writing as part of Javanese,
                and thus Indonesian culture heritage. I thought to myself,
                why not create a documentation of my own cultural heritage as I am my self a Javanese person that has probably live and spent my whole life in Indonesia and on Java Island to be more specific.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is still far from perfect, and by any means it is still incomplete.
                Therefore, you might learn a bit about Javanese script, but if you are really interested,
                you might wanted to go through other sources that are much complete and thorough.
            </p>

                This website is initially made as an assignment on Web Development for CS50T to complete the the final challenge,
                which is to build a website. And <i>voila</i>, I did it by taking an idea to introduce a little bit of Indonesian culture —
                Javanese writing!
